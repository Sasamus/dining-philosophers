/*
 * I'll first note that I've worked with an alternative version of the "Dining Philosophers" problem
 * where instead of spaghetti and forks, rice and chopsticks are used. It just seems to make more sense
 * in an admittedly strange situation where clean eating utensils are rare.
 *
 * My solution works with a Table class that holds information about the
 * philosophers seated around it and the chopsticks placed on it.
 *
 * The Philosophers are made aware of the the chopsticks, which are implemented as mutexes, on either side of them.
 * While the philosophers go through their cycle of eating and thinking they use the lock function
 * from the <mutex> library to lock two mutexes (the chopsticks) at once or wait until both are available,
 * this eliminates the risk of deadlock.
 *
 * And using the "eating = philosophers/2" algorithm to asses how it performs
 * it seems to achieve this number consistently.
